## EKF SLAM algorithm for Sensor Signal and Data Processing (EE5020)
Basic algorithm creates robot object, generates (semi) random trajectory and estimates trajectory based on range-bearing measurements.
Advanced algorithm is able to detect moving landmarks (work in progress).

Basic algorithm is based on “Robot Mapping - WS 2013/14,” 21 10 2018. [Online]. Available: http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ws13/mapping/.
